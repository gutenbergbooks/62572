<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>Toward the close of the year
1823, Mr. Lemon, deputy keeper
of the state papers, in the course of his
researches among the presses of his
office, met with a large Latin manuscript.
With it were found corrected
copies of the foreign despatches written
by Milton, while he filled the office of
Secretary, and several papers relating to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the Popish Trials and the Rye-House
Plot. The whole was wrapped up in
an envelope, superscribed <em>To Mr. Skinner,
Merchant</em>. On examination, the
large manuscript proved to be the long
lost Essay on the Doctrines of Christianity,
which, according to Wood and
Toland, Milton finished after the Restoration,
and deposited with Cyriac
Skinner. Skinner, it is well known,
held the same political opinions with
his illustrious friend. It is therefore
probable, as Mr. Lemon conjectures,
that he may have fallen under the
suspicions of the government during
that persecution of the Whigs which
followed the dissolution of the Oxford
parliament, and that, in consequence
of a general seizure of his papers, this
work may have been brought to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
office in which it has been found. But
whatever the adventures of the manuscript
may have been, no doubt can
exist that it is a genuine relic of the
great poet.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner, who was commanded
by his Majesty to edit and translate
the treatise, has acquitted himself of
his task in a manner honourable to his
talents and to his character. His version
is not indeed very easy or elegant;
but it is entitled to the praise of clearness
and fidelity. His notes abound
with interesting quotations, and have
the rare merit of really elucidating the
text. The preface is evidently the
work of a sensible and candid man,
firm in his own religious opinions, and
tolerant toward those of others.</p>

<p>The book itself will not add much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
to the fame of Milton. It is, like all
his Latin works, well written, though
not exactly in the style of the prize
essays of Oxford and Cambridge.
There is no elaborate imitation of
classical antiquity, no scrupulous purity,
none of the ceremonial cleanness
which characterises the diction of our
academical Pharisees. The author does
not attempt to polish and brighten his
composition into the Ciceronian gloss
and brilliancy. He does not in short
sacrifice sense and spirit to pedantic
refinements. The nature of his subject
compelled him to use many words</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; ">"That would have made Quintilian stare and gasp."</p>

<p>But he writes with as much ease and
freedom as if Latin were his mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
tongue; and, where he is least happy,
his failure seems to arise from the carelessness
of a native, not from the ignorance
of a foreigner. We may apply to
him what Denham with great felicity
says of Cowley. He wears the garb,
but not the clothes of the ancients.</p>

<p>Throughout the volume are discernible
the traces of a powerful and independent
mind, emancipated from the
influence of authority, and devoted to
the search of truth. Milton professes
to form his system from the Bible
alone; and his digest of Scriptural
texts is certainly among the best that
have appeared. But he is not always
so happy in his inferences as in his
citations.</p>

<p>Some of the heterodox doctrines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
which he avows seemed to have excited
considerable amazement, particularly
his Arianism, and his theory on
the subject of polygamy. Yet we can
scarcely conceive that any person could
have read the "Paradise Lost" without
suspecting him of the former; nor do
we think that any reader, acquainted
with the history of his life, ought to
be much startled at the latter. The
opinions which he has expressed respecting
the nature of the Deity, the
eternity of matter, and the observation
of the Sabbath, might, we think, have
caused more just surprise.</p>

<p>But we will not go into the discussion
of these points. The book, were
it far more orthodox or far more heretical
than it is, would not much edify
or corrupt the present generation. The
men of our time are not to be converted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
or perverted by quartos. A few
more days, and this essay will follow
the <cite>Defensio Populi</cite>, to the dust and
silence of the upper shelf. The name
of its author, and the remarkable circumstances
attending its publication,
will secure to it a certain degree of
attention. For a month or two it will
occupy a few minutes of chat in every
drawing-room, and a few columns in
every magazine; and it will then, to
borrow the elegant language of the
play-bills, be withdrawn, to make room
for the forthcoming novelties.</p>

<p>We wish, however, to avail ourselves
of the interest, transient as it
may be, which this work has excited.
The dexterous Capuchins never choose
to preach on the life and miracles of a
saint till they have awakened the devotional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
feelings of their auditors by
exhibiting some relic of him, a thread
of his garment, a lock of his hair, or a
drop of his blood. On the same principle,
we intend to take advantage
of the late interesting discovery, and,
while this memorial of a great and
good man is still in the hands of all,
to say something of his moral and
intellectual qualities. Nor, we are
convinced, will the severest of our
readers blame us if, on an occasion
like the present, we turn for a short
time from the topics of the day, to
commemorate, in all love and reverence,
the genius and virtues of John
Milton, the poet, the statesman, the
philosopher, the glory of English literature,
the champion and the martyr
of English liberty.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>It is by his poetry that Milton is
best known; and it is of his poetry
that we wish first to speak. By the
general suffrage of the civilised world,
his place has been assigned among the
greatest masters of the art. His detractors,
however, though outvoted,
have not been silenced. There are
many critics, and some of great name,
who contrive in the same breath to
extol the poems and to decry the poet.
The works they acknowledge, considered
in themselves, may be classed
among the noblest productions of the
human mind. But they will not allow
the author to rank with those great
men who, born in the infancy of civilisation,
supplied, by their own powers,
the want of instruction, and, though
destitute of models themselves, bequeathed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
to posterity models which
defy imitation. Milton, it is said, inherited
what his predecessors created;
he lived in an enlightened age; he
received a finished education; and we
must therefore, if we would form a
just estimate of his powers, make large
deductions in consideration of these
advantages.</p>

<p>We venture to say, on the contrary,
paradoxical as the remark may appear,
that no poet has ever had to struggle
with more unfavourable circumstances
than Milton. He doubted, as he has
himself owned, whether he had not
been born "an age too late." For
this notion Johnson has thought fit to
make him the butt of much clumsy
ridicule. The poet, we believe, understood
the nature of his art better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the critic. He knew that his poetical
genius derived no advantage from the
civilisation which surrounded him, or
from the learning which he had acquired;
and he looked back with something
like regret to the ruder age of
simple words and vivid impressions.</p>

<p>We think that, as civilisation advances,
poetry almost necessarily declines.
Therefore, though we fervently
admire those great works of imagination
which have appeared in dark ages,
we do not admire them the more because
they have appeared in dark ages.
On the contrary, we hold that the most
wonderful and splendid proof of genius
is a great poem produced in a civilised
age. We cannot understand why those
who believe in that most orthodox article
of literary faith, that the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
poets are generally the best, should
wonder at the rule as if it were the exception.
Surely the uniformity of the
phenomenon indicates a corresponding
uniformity in the cause.</p>

<p>The fact is, that common observers
reason from the progress of the experimental
science to that of the imitative
arts. The improvement of the former
is gradual and slow. Ages are spent
in collecting materials, ages more in
separating and combining them. Even
when a system has been formed, there
is still something to add, to alter, or to
reject. Every generation enjoys the
use of a vast hoard bequeathed to it by
antiquity, and transmits that hoard,
augmented by fresh acquisitions, to
future ages. In these pursuits, therefore,
the first speculators lie under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
great disadvantages, and, even when
they fail, are entitled to praise. Their
pupils, with far inferior intellectual
powers, speedily surpass them in actual
attainments. Every girl who has read
Mrs. Marcet's little dialogues on Political
Economy could teach Montague
or Walpole many lessons in finance.
Any intelligent man may now, by resolutely
applying himself for a few years
to mathematics, learn more than the
great Newton knew after half a century
of study and meditation.</p>

<p>But it is not thus with music, with
painting, or with sculpture. Still less
is it thus with poetry. The progress
of refinement rarely supplies these arts
with better objects of imitation. It
may indeed improve the instruments
which are necessary to the mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
operations of the musician, the sculptor,
and the painter. But language,
the machine of the poet, is best fitted
for his purpose in its rudest state. Nations,
like individuals, first perceive,
and then abstract. They advance
from particular images to general
terms. Hence the vocabulary of an
enlightened society is philosophical,
that of a half-civilised people is poetical.</p>

<p>This change in the language of men
is partly the cause and partly the effect
of a corresponding change in the nature
of their intellectual operations, of
a change by which science gains and
poetry loses. Generalisation is necessary
to the advancement of knowledge;
but particularly is indispensable to the
creations of the imagination. In pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>portion
as men know more and think
more, they look less at individuals and
more at classes. They therefore make
better theories and worse poems. They
give us vague phrases instead of images,
and personified qualities instead of men.
They may be better able to analyse
human nature than their predecessors.
But analysis is not the business of the
poet. His office is to portray, not to
dissect. He may believe in a moral
sense, like Shaftesbury; he may refer
all human actions to self-interest, like
Helvetius; or he may never think
about the matter at all. His creed on
such subjects will no more influence
his poetry, properly so called, than the
notions which a painter may have conceived
respecting the lacrymal glands,
or the circulation of the blood, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
affect the tears of his Niobe, or the
blushes of his Aurora. If Shakespeare
had written a book on the motives of
human actions, it is by no means certain
that it would have been a good
one. It is extremely improbable that
it would have contained half so much
able reasoning on the subject as is to be
found in the Fable of the Bees. But
could Mandeville have created an Iago?
Well as he knew how to resolve characters
into their elements, would he
have been able to combine those elements
in such a manner as to make
up a man, a real, living, individual
man?</p>

<p>Perhaps no person can be a poet, or
can even enjoy poetry, without a certain
unsoundness of mind, if anything
which gives so much pleasure ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
be called unsoundness. By poetry we
mean not all writing in verse, nor even
all good writing in verse. Our definition
excludes many metrical compositions
which, on other grounds, deserve
the highest praise. By poetry we
mean the art of employing words in
such a manner as to produce an illusion
on the imagination, the art of
doing by means of words what the
painter does by means of colours.
Thus the greatest of poets has described
it, in lines universally admired
for the vigour and felicity of their
diction, and still more valuable on
account of the just notion which they
convey of the art in which he excelled.</p>

<div class="verse">A local habitation and a name."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These are the fruits of the "fine
frenzy" which he ascribes to the poet,&mdash;a
fine frenzy doubtless, but still a
frenzy. Truth, indeed, is essential to
poetry; but it is the truth of madness.
The reasonings are just; but the premises
are false. After the first suppositions
have been made, everything
ought to be consistent; but those first
suppositions require a degree of credulity
which almost amounts to a partial
and temporary derangement of the intellect.
Hence of all people children
are the most imaginative. They abandon
themselves without reserve to every
illusion. Every image which is strongly
presented to their mental eye produces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
on them the effect of reality. No
man, whatever his sensibility may be,
is ever affected by Hamlet or Lear, as
a little girl is affected by the story of
poor Red Riding-hood. She knows
that it is all false, that wolves cannot
speak, that there are no wolves in
England. Yet in spite of her knowledge
she believes; she weeps; she
trembles; she dares not go into a dark
room lest she should feel the teeth of
the monster at her throat. Such is the
despotism of the imagination over uncultivated
minds.</p>

<p>In a rude state of society men are
children with a greater variety of ideas.
It is therefore in such a state of society
that we may expect to find the poetical
temperament in its highest perfection.
In an enlightened age there will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
much intelligence, much science, much
philosophy, abundance of just classification
and subtle analysis, abundance
of wit and eloquence, abundance of
verses, and even of good ones; but
little poetry. Men will judge and
compare; but they will not create.
They will talk about the old poets, and
comment on them, and to a certain
degree enjoy them. But they will
scarcely be able to conceive the effect
which poetry produced on their ruder
ancestors, the agony, the ecstasy, the
plenitude of belief. The Greek Rhapsodists,
according to Plato, could scarce
recite Homer without falling into convulsions.
The Mohawk hardly feels
the scalping knife while he shouts his
death-song. The power which the
ancient bards of Wales and Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
exercised over their auditors seems to
modern readers almost miraculous.
Such feelings are very rare in a civilised
community, and most rare among those
who participate most in its improvements.
They linger longest among
the peasantry.</p>

<p>Poetry produces an illusion on the
eye of the mind, as a magic lantern
produces an illusion on the eye of the
body. And, as the magic lantern acts
best in a dark room, poetry effects its
purpose most completely in a dark age.
As the light of knowledge breaks in
upon its exhibitions, as the outlines of
certainty become more and more definite,
and the shades of probability more
and more distinct, the hues and lineaments
of the phantoms which the poet
calls up grow fainter and fainter. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
cannot unite the incompatible advantages
of reality and deception, the clear
discernment of truth and the exquisite
enjoyment of fiction.</p>

<p>He who, in an enlightened and literary
society, aspires to be a great poet,
must first become a little child. He
must take to pieces the whole web of
his mind. He must unlearn much of
that knowledge which has perhaps constituted
hitherto his chief title to superiority.
His very talents will be a
hindrance to him. His difficulties will
be proportioned to his proficiency in
the pursuits which are fashionable
among his contemporaries; and that
proficiency will in general be proportioned
to the vigour and activity of his
mind. And it is well if, after all his
sacrifices and exertions, his works do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
not resemble a lisping man or a modern
ruin. We have seen in our own time
great talents, intense labour, and long
meditation, employed in this struggle
against the spirit of the age, and employed,
we will not say, absolutely in
vain, but with dubious success and
feeble applause.</p>

<p>If these reasonings be just, no poet
has ever triumphed over greater difficulties
than Milton. He received a
learned education; he was a profound
and elegant classical scholar; he had
studied all the mysteries of Rabbinical
literature; he was intimately acquainted
with every language of modern Europe,
from which either pleasure or information
was then to be derived. He was
perhaps the only great poet of later
times who has been distinguished by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the excellence of his Latin verse. The
genius of Petrarch was scarcely of the
first order; and his poems in the ancient
language, though much praised by those
who have never read them, are wretched
compositions. Cowley, with all his
admirable wit and ingenuity, had little
imagination; nor indeed do we think
his classical diction comparable to that
of Milton. The authority of Johnson
is against us on this point. But Johnson
had studied the bad writers of the
middle ages till he had become utterly
insensible to the Augustan elegance,
and was as ill qualified to judge between
two Latin styles as a habitual drunkard
to set up for a wine-taster.</p>

<p>Versification in a dead language is
an exotic, a far-fetched, costly, sickly,
imitation of that which elsewhere may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
be found in healthful and spontaneous
perfection. The soils on which this
rarity flourishes are in general as ill-suited
to the production of vigorous
native poetry as the flower-pots of
a hothouse to the growth of oaks.
That the author of the Paradise Lost
should have written the Epistle to
Manso was truly wonderful. Never
before were such marked originality
and such exquisite mimicry found together.
Indeed in all the Latin poems
of Milton the artificial manner indispensable
to such works is admirably
preserved, while, at the same time, his
genius gives to them a peculiar charm,
an air of nobleness and freedom, which
distinguishes them from all other writings
of the same class. They remind
us of the amusements of those angelic
warriors who composed the cohort of
Gabriel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>"About him exercised heroic games<br />
The unarmed youth of heaven. But o'er their heads<br />
Celestial armory, shield, helm, and spear,<br />
Hung high, with diamond flaming and with gold."</p>

</div>


<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>We cannot look upon the sportive
exercises for which the genius of Milton
ungirds itself without catching a
glimpse of the gorgeous and terrible
panoply which it is accustomed to
wear. The strength of his imagination
triumphed over every obstacle.
So intense and ardent was the fire of
his mind, that it not only was not
suffocated beneath the weight of fuel,
but penetrated the whole superincum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>bent
mass with its own heart and
radiance.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to attempt
anything like a complete examination
of the poetry of Milton. The public
has long been agreed as to the merit
of the most remarkable passages, the
incomparable harmony of the numbers,
and the excellence of that style, which
no rival has been able to equal, and no
parodist to degrade, which displays in
their highest perfection the idiomistic
powers of the English tongue, and to
which every ancient and every modern
language has contributed something of
grace, of energy, or of music. In the
vast field of criticism on which we are
entering innumerable reapers have already
put their sickles. Yet the harvest
is so abundant that the negligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
search of a straggling gleaner may be
rewarded with a sheaf.</p>

<p>The most striking characteristic of
the poetry of Milton is the extreme
remoteness of the associations by
means of which it acts on the reader.
Its effect is produced, not so much
by what it expresses, as by what it
suggests; not so much by the ideas
which it directly conveys, as by
other ideas which are connected with
them. He electrifies the mind through
conductors. The most unimaginative
man must understand the Iliad. Homer
gives him no choice, and requires from
him no exertion, but takes the whole
upon himself, and sets the images
in so clear a light, that it is impossible
to be blind to them. The works
of Milton cannot be comprehended or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
enjoyed, unless the mind of the reader
co&ouml;perate with that of the writer. He
does not paint a finished picture, or
play for a mere passive listener. He
sketches, and leaves others to fill up
the outline. He strikes the key-note,
and expects his hearer to make out the
melody.</p>

<p>We often hear of the magical influence
of poetry. The expression in
general means nothing: but, applied
to the writings of Milton, it is most
appropriate. His poetry acts like an
incantation. Its merit lies less in its
obvious meaning than in its occult
power. There would seem, at first
sight, to be no more in his words than
in other words. But they are words
of enchantment. No sooner are they
pronounced, than the past is present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and the distant near. New forms of
beauty start at once into existence, and
all the burial-places of the memory
give up their dead. Change the structure
of the sentence; substitute one
synonyme for another, and the whole
effect is destroyed. The spell loses
its power; and he who should then
hope to conjure with it would find
himself as much mistaken as Cassim
in the Arabian tale, when he stood
crying, "Open Wheat," "Open Barley,"
to the door which obeyed no
sound but "Open Sesame." The
miserable failure of Dryden in his
attempt to translate into his own
diction some part of the Paradise
Lost, is a remarkable instance of
this.</p>

<p>In support of these observations, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
may remark that scarcely any passages
in the poems of Milton are more generally
known or more frequently repeated
than those which are little more
than muster-rolls of names. They are
not always more appropriate or more
melodious than other names. But they
are charmed names. Every one of them
is the first link in a long chain of associated
ideas. Like the dwelling-place
of our infancy revisited in manhood,
like the song of our country heard in a
strange land, they produce upon us an
effect wholly independent of their intrinsic
value. One transports us back
to a remote period of history. Another
places us among the novel scenes and
manners of a distant region. A third
evokes all the dear classical recollections
of childhood, the schoolroom, the dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>eared
Virgil, the holiday, and the prize.
A fourth brings before us the splendid
phantoms of chivalrous romance, the
trophied lists, the embroidered housings,
the quaint devices, the haunted forests,
the enchanted gardens, the achievements
of enamoured knights, and the smiles
of rescued princesses.</p>

<p>In none of the works of Milton
is his peculiar manner more happily
displayed than in Allegro and the
Penseroso. It is impossible to conceive
that the mechanism of language
can be brought to a more exquisite
degree of perfection. These poems
differ from others, as attar of roses differs
from ordinary rose water, the close
packed essence from the thin diluted
mixture. They are, indeed, not so
much poems, as collections of hints,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
from each of which the reader is to
make out a poem for himself. Every
epithet is a text for a stanza.</p>

<p>The Comus and the Samson Agonistes
are works which, though of very
different merit, offer some marked
points of resemblance. Both are
lyric poems in the form of plays.
There are, perhaps, no two kinds of
composition so essentially dissimilar as
the drama and the ode. The business
of the dramatist is to keep himself out
of sight, and to let nothing appear but
his characters. As soon as he attracts
notice to his personal feelings, the illusion
is broken. The effect is as unpleasant
as that which is produced on
the stage by the voice of a prompter
or the entrance of a scene-shifter.
Hence it was, that the tragedies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Byron were his least successful performances.
They resemble those
pasteboard pictures invented by the
friend of children, Mr. Newbury, in
which a single movable head goes
round twenty different bodies, so that
the same face looks out upon us successively,
from the uniform of a hussar,
the furs of a judge, and the rags of a
beggar. In all the characters, patriots
and tyrants, haters and lovers, the frown
and sneer of Harold were discernible in
an instant. But this species of egotism,
though fatal to the drama, is the inspiration
of the ode. It is the part of the
lyric poet to abandon himself, without
reserve, to his own emotion.</p>

<p>Between these hostile elements many
great men have endeavoured to effect
an amalgamation, but never with com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>plete
success. The Greek drama, on
the model of which the Samson was
written, sprang from the Ode. The
dialogue was ingrafted on the chorus,
and naturally partook of its character.
The genius of the greatest of the Athenian
dramatists co&ouml;perated with the circumstances
under which tragedy made
its first appearance. &AElig;schylus was,
head and heart, a lyric poet. In his
time, the Greeks had far more intercourse
with the East than in the days
of Homer; and they had not yet acquired
that immense superiority in war, in science,
and in the arts, which, in the following
generation, led them to treat the
Asiatics with contempt. From the
narrative of Herodotus it should seem
that they still looked up, with the disciples,
to Egypt and Assyria. At this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
period, accordingly, it was natural that
the literature of Greece should be tinctured
with the Oriental style. And that
style, we think, is discernible in the
works of Pindar and &AElig;schylus. The
latter often reminds us of the Hebrew
writers. The book of Job, indeed, in
conduct and diction, bears a considerable
resemblance to some of his dramas.
Considered as plays, his works are absurd;
considered as choruses, they are
above all praise. If, for instance, we
examine the address of Clytemnestra
to Agamemnon on his return, or the
description of the seven Argive chiefs,
by the principles of dramatic writing,
we shall instantly condemn them as
monstrous. But if we forget the characters,
and think only of the poetry,
we shall admit that it has never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
been surpassed in energy and magnificence.
Sophocles made the Greek
drama as dramatic as was consistent
with its original form. His portraits
of men have a sort of similarity; but
it is the similarity not of a painting,
but of a bas-relief. It suggests a resemblance;
but it does not produce an
illusion. Euripides attempted to carry
the reform further. But it was a task
far beyond his powers, perhaps beyond
any powers. Instead of correcting what
was bad, he destroyed what was excellent.
He substituted crutches for stilts,
bad sermons for good odes.</p>

<p>Milton, it is well known, admired
Euripides highly, much more highly
than, in our opinion, Euripides deserved.
Indeed the caresses which
this partiality leads our countryman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to bestow on "sad Electra's poet"
sometimes remind us of the beautiful
Queen of Fairy-land kissing the long
ears of Bottom. At all events, there
can be no doubt that this veneration
for the Athenian, whether just or not,
was injurious to the Samson Agonistes.
Had Milton taken &AElig;schylus
for his model, he would have given
himself up to the lyric inspiration, and
poured out profusely all the treasures
of his mind, without bestowing a
thought on those dramatic proprieties
which the nature of the work rendered
it impossible to preserve. In the attempt
to reconcile things in their own
nature inconsistent, he has failed, as
every one else must have failed. We
cannot identify ourselves with the
characters, as in a good play. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
cannot identify ourselves with the
poet, as in a good ode. The conflicting
ingredients, like an acid and an alkali
mixed, neutralise each other. We are
by no means insensible to the merits
of this celebrated piece, to the severe
dignity of the style, the graceful and
pathetic solemnity of the opening
speech, or the wild and barbaric melody
which gives so striking an effect
to the choral passages. But we think
it, we confess, the least successful
effort of the genius of Milton.</p>

<p>The Comus is framed on the model
of the Italian Masque, as the Samson is
framed on the model of the Greek
Tragedy. It is certainly the noblest
performance of the kind which exists
in any language. It is as far superior
to the Faithful Shepherdess, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Faithful Shepherdess is to the Aminta,
or the Aminta to the Pastor Fido. It
was well for Milton that he had here
no Euripides to mislead him. He
understood and loved the literature of
modern Italy. But he did not feel for
it the same veneration which he entertained
for the remains of Athenian and
Roman poetry, consecrated by so many
lofty and endearing recollections. The
faults, moreover, of his Italian predecessors
were of a kind to which his mind
had a deadly antipathy. He could stoop
to a plain style, sometimes even to a
bald style; but false brilliancy was his
utter aversion. His muse had no
objection to a russet attire; but she
turned with disgust from the finery of
Guarini, as tawdry and as paltry as the
rags of a chimney-sweeper on May-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Whatever ornaments she wears are of
massive gold, not only dazzling to the
sight, but capable of standing the
severest test of the crucible.</p>

<p>Milton attended in the Comus to the
distinction which he afterwards neglected
in the Samson. He made his
Masque what it ought to be, essentially
lyrical, and dramatic only in semblance.
He has not attempted a fruitless struggle
against a defect inherent in the
nature of that species of composition;
and he has therefore succeeded, wherever
success was not impossible. The
speeches must be read as majestic
soliloquies; and he who so reads them
will be enraptured with their eloquence,
their sublimity, and their music. The
interruptions of the dialogue, however,
impose a constraint upon the writer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and break the illusion of the reader.
The finest passages are those which
are lyric in form as well as in spirit.
"I should much commend," says the
excellent Sir Henry Wotten in a letter
to Milton, "the tragical part if the
lyrical did not ravish me with a certain
Dorique delicacy in your songs and
odes, whereunto, I must plainly confess
to you, I have seen yet nothing
parallel in our language." The criticism
was just. It is when Milton escapes
from the shackles of the dialogue,
when he is discharged from the labour
of uniting two incongruous styles, when
he is at liberty to indulge his choral
raptures without reserve, that he rises
even above himself. Then, like his
own good Genius bursting from the
earthly form and weeds of Thyrsis, he
stands forth in celestial freedom and
beauty; he seems to cry exultingly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>"Now my task is smoothly done,<br />
I can fly or I can run,"</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>to skim the earth, to soar above the
clouds, to bathe in the Elysian dew of
the rainbow, and to inhale the balmy
smells of nard and cassia, which the
musky winds of the zephyr scatter
through the cedared alleys of the
Hesperides.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER IV</h2>



<p>There are several of the minor poems
of Milton on which we would willingly
make a few remarks. Still more willingly
would we enter into a detailed
examination of that admirable poem,
the Paradise Regained, which, strangely
enough, is scarcely ever mentioned
except as an instance of the blindness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of the parental affection which
men of letters bear toward the offspring
of their intellects. That Milton was
mistaken in preferring this work, excellent
as it is, to the Paradise Lost, we
readily admit. But we are sure that
the superiority of the Paradise Lost
to the Paradise Regained is not more
decided than the superiority of the
Paradise Regained to every poem
which has since made its appearance.
Our limits, however, prevent us from
discussing the point at length. We
hasten on to that extraordinary production
which the general suffrage of
critics has placed in the highest class
of human compositions.</p>

<p>The only poem of modern times
which can be compared with the Paradise
Lost is the Divine Comedy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
The subject of Milton, in some points,
resembled that of Dante; but he has
treated it in a widely different manner.
We cannot, we think, better illustrate
our opinion respecting our own great
poet, than by contrasting him with the
father of Tuscan literature.</p>

<p>The poetry of Milton differs from
that of Dante, as the hieroglyphics of
Egypt differed from the picture-writing
of Mexico. The images which Dante
employs speak for themselves; they
stand simply for what they are. Those
of Milton have a signification which is
often discernible only to the initiated.
Their value depends less on what they
directly represent than on what they
remotely suggest. However strange,
however grotesque, may be the appearance
which Dante undertakes to describe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
he never shrinks from describing
it. He gives us the shape, the colour,
the sound, the smell, the taste; he
counts the numbers; he measures the
size. His similes are the illustrations
of a traveller. Unlike those of other
poets, and especially of Milton, they
are introduced in a plain, businesslike
manner; not for the sake of any
beauty in the objects from which they
are drawn; not for the sake of any ornament
which they may impart to the
poem; but simply in order to make
the meaning of the writer as clear to
the reader as it is to himself. The
ruins of the precipice which led from
the sixth to the seventh circle of hell
were like those of the rock which fell
into the Adige on the south of Trent.
The cataract of Phlegethon was like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
that of Aqua Cheta at the monastery
of St. Benedict. The place where the
heretics were confined in burning tombs
resembled the vast cemetery of Arles.</p>

<p>Now let us compare with the exact
details of Dante the dim intimations
of Milton. We will cite a few examples.
The English poet has never
thought of taking the measure of Satan.
He gives us merely a vague idea of
vast bulk. In one passage the fiend
lies stretched out huge in length, floating
many a rood, equal in size to the
earth-born enemies of Jove, or to the
sea-monster which the mariner mistakes
for an island. When he addresses
himself to battle against the
guardian angels, he stands like Teneriffe
or Atlas: his stature reaches the
sky. Contrast with these descriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the lines in which Dante has described
the gigantic spectre of Nimrod. "His
face seemed to me as long and as broad
as the ball of St. Peter's at Rome; and
his other limbs were in proportion; so
that the bank, which concealed him
from the waist downwards, nevertheless
showed so much of him, that three
tall Germans would in vain have attempted
to reach to his hair." We are
sensible that we do no justice to the
admirable style of the Florentine poet.
But Mr. Cary's translation is not at
hand; and our version, however rude,
is sufficient to illustrate our meaning.</p>

<p>Once more, compare the lazar-house
in the eleventh book of the
Paradise Lost with the last ward of
Malebolge in Dante. Milton avoids
the loathsome details, and takes refuge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
in indistinct but solemn and tremendous
imagery. Despair hurrying from
couch to couch to mock the wretches
with his attendance, Death shaking his
dart over them, but, in spite of supplications,
delaying to strike. What says
Dante? "There was such a moan
there as there would be if all the sick
who, between July and September, are
in the hospitals of Valdichiana, and of
the Tuscan swamps, and of Sardinia,
were in one pit together; and such a
stench was issuing forth as is wont to
issue from decayed limbs."</p>

<p>We will not take upon ourselves the
invidious office of settling precedency
between two such writers. Each in
his own department is incomparable;
and each, we may remark, has wisely,
or fortunately, taken a subject adapted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to exhibit his peculiar talent to the
greatest advantage. The Divine Comedy
is a personal narrative. Dante is
the eye-witness and ear-witness of that
which he relates. He is the very man
who has heard the tormented spirits
crying out for the second death, who
has read the dusky characters on the
portal within which there is no hope,
who has hidden his face from the terrors
of the Gorgon, who has fled from
the hooks and the seething pitch of
Barbariccia and Draghignazzo. His
own hands have grasped the shaggy
sides of Lucifer. His own feet have
climbed the mountain of expiation.
His own brow has been marked by
the purifying angel. The reader would
throw aside such a tale in incredulous
disgust, unless it were told with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
strongest air of veracity, with a sobriety
even in its horrors, with the greatest
precision and multiplicity in its
details. The narrative of Milton in
this respect differs from that of Dante,
as the adventures of Amadis differ from
those of Gulliver. The author of
Amadis would have made his book
ridiculous if he had introduced those
minute particulars which give such a
charm to the work of Swift, the nautical
observations, the affected delicacy
about names, the official documents
transcribed at full length, and all the
unmeaning gossip and scandal of the
court, springing out of nothing, and
tending to nothing. We are not
shocked at being told that a man
who lived, nobody knows when, saw
many very strange sights, and we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
easily abandon ourselves to the illusion
of the romance. But when Lemuel
Gulliver, surgeon, resident at Rotherhithe,
tells us of pygmies and giants,
dying islands, and philosophising horses,
nothing but such circumstantial touches
could produce for a single moment a
deception on the imagination.</p>

<p>Of all the poets who have introduced
into their works the agency of
supernatural beings, Milton has succeeded
best. Here Dante decidedly
yields to him: and as this is a point
on which many rash and ill-considered
judgments have been pronounced, we
feel inclined to dwell on it a little
longer. The most fatal error which
a poet can possibly commit, in the
management of his machinery, is that
of attempting to philosophise too much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Milton has been often censured for ascribing
to spirits many functions of
which spirits must be incapable. But
these objections, though sanctioned by
eminent names, originate, we venture
to say, in profound ignorance of the
art of poetry.</p>

<p>What is spirit? What are our own
minds, the portion of spirit with which
we are best acquainted? We observe
certain phenomena. We cannot explain
them into material causes. We
therefore infer that there exists something
which is not material. But of
this something we have no idea. We
can define it only by negatives. We
can reason about it only by symbols.
We use the word: but we have no
image of the thing; and the business
of poetry is with images, and not with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
words. The poet uses words indeed;
but they are merely the instruments of
his art, not its objects. They are the
materials which he is to dispose in
such a manner as to present a picture
to the mental eye. And if they are
not so disposed, they are no more
entitled to be called poetry than a
bale of canvas and a box of colours
to be called a painting.</p>

<p>Logicians may reason about abstractions.
But the great mass of men
must have images. The strong tendency
of the multitude in all ages and
nations to idolatry can be explained on
no other principle. The first inhabitants
of Greece, there is reason to believe,
worshipped one invisible Deity.
But the necessity of having something
more definite to adore produced, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
few centuries, the innumerable crowd
of gods and goddesses. In like manner
the ancient Persians thought it
impious to exhibit the Creator under
a human form. Yet even these transferred
to the Sun the worship which,
in speculation, they considered due only
to the Supreme Mind. The history of
the Jews is the record of a continued
struggle between pure Theism, supported
by the most terrible sanctions,
and the strangely fascinating desire of
having some visible and tangible object
of adoration. Perhaps none of the
secondary causes which Gibbon has
assigned for the rapidity with which
Christianity spread over the world,
while Judaism scarcely ever acquired
a proselyte, operated more powerfully
than this feeling. God, the uncreated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the incomprehensible, the invisible,
attracted few worshippers. A philosopher
might admire so noble a conception:
but the crowd turned away
in disgust from words which presented
no image to their minds. It was before
Deity embodied in a human form,
walking among men, partaking of their
infirmities, leaning on their bosoms,
weeping over their graves, slumbering
in the manger, bleeding on the cross,
that the prejudices of the Synagogue,
and the doubts of the Academy, and
the pride of the portico, and the fasces
of the Lictor, and the swords of thirty
legions, were humbled in the dust.
Soon after Christianity had achieved
its triumph, the principle which had
assisted it began to corrupt it. It became
a new Paganism. Patron saints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
assumed the offices of household gods.
St. George took the place of Mars.
St. Elmo consoled the mariner for the
loss of Castor and Pollux. The Virgin
Mother and Cecilia succeeded to
Venus and the Muses. The fascination
of sex and loveliness was again
joined to that of celestial dignity; and
the homage of chivalry was blended
with that of religion. Reformers have
often made a stand against these feelings;
but never with more than apparent
and partial success. The men
who demolished the images in cathedrals
have not always been able to demolish
those which were enshrined
in their minds. It would not be difficult
to show that in politics the same
rule holds good. Doctrines, we are
afraid, must generally be embodied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
before they can excite a strong public
feeling. The multitude is more
easily interested for the most unmeaning
badge, or the most insignificant
name, than for the most important
principle.</p>

<p>From these considerations, we infer
that no poet, who should affect that
metaphysical accuracy for the want of
which Milton has been blamed, would
escape a disgraceful failure. Still, however,
there was another extreme, which,
though far less dangerous, was also to
be avoided. The imaginations of men
are in a great measure under the control
of their opinions. The most exquisite
art of poetical colouring can
produce no illusion, when it is employed
to represent that which is at
once perceived to be incongruous and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
absurd. Milton wrote in an age of
philosophers and theologians. It was
necessary, therefore, for him to abstain
from giving such a shock to their
understandings as might break the
charm which it was his object to
throw over their imaginations. This
is the real explanation of the indistinctness
and inconsistency with which
he has often been reproached. Doctor
Johnson acknowledges that it was
absolutely necessary that the spirit
should be clothed with material forms.
"But," says he, "the poet should have
secured the consistency of his system by
keeping immateriality out of sight, and
seducing the reader to drop it from his
thoughts." This is easily said; but
what if Milton could not seduce his
readers to drop immateriality from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
their thoughts? What if the contrary
opinion had taken so fully possession
of the minds of men as to
leave no room even for the half belief
which poetry requires? Such we
suspect to have been the case. It was
impossible for the poet to adopt altogether
the material or the immaterial
system. He therefore took his stand
on the debatable ground. He left the
whole in ambiguity. He has, doubtless,
by so doing, laid himself open
to the charge of inconsistency. But,
though philosophically in the wrong,
we cannot but believe that he was
poetically in the right. This task,
which almost any other writer would
have found impracticable, was easy to
him. The peculiar art which he possessed
of communicating his meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
circuitously through a long succession
of associated ideas, and of intimating
more than he expressed, enabled him
to disguise those incongruities which
he could not avoid.</p>

<p>Poetry which relates to the beings
of another world ought to be at once
mysterious and picturesque. That of
Milton is so. That of Dante is picturesque
indeed beyond any that was
ever written. Its effect approaches to
that produced by the pencil or the
chisel. But it is picturesque to the
exclusion of all mystery. This is a
fault on the right side, a fault inseparable
from the plan of Dante's poem,
which, as we have already observed,
rendered the utmost accuracy of description
necessary. Still it is a fault.
The supernatural agents excite an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>terest;
but it is not the interest which
is proper to supernatural agents. We
feel that we could talk to the ghosts
and demons without any emotion of
unearthly awe. We could, like Don
Juan, ask them to supper, and eat
heartily in their company. Dante's
angels are good men with wings. His
devils are spiteful ugly executioners.
His dead men are merely living men in
strange situations. The scene which
passes between the poet and Farinata is
justly celebrated. Still, Farinata in the
burning tomb is exactly what Farinata
would have been at an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auto da fe</i>.
Nothing can be more touching than
the first interview of Dante and Beatrice.
Yet what is it, but a lovely
woman chiding, with sweet austere
composure, the lover for whose affec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>tion
she is grateful, but whose vices
she reprobates? The feelings which
give the passage its charm would suit
the streets of Florence as well as the
summit of the Mount of Purgatory.</p>

<p>The spirits of Milton are unlike those
of almost all other writers. His fiends,
in particular, are wonderful creations.
They are not metaphysical abstractions.
They are not wicked men. They are
not ugly beasts. They have no horns,
no tails, none of the fee-faw-fum of
Tasso and Klopstock. They have just
enough in common with human nature
to be intelligible to human beings.
Their characters are, like their forms,
marked by a certain dim resemblance
to those of men, but exaggerated to
gigantic dimensions, and veiled in mysterious
gloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the gods and demons of
&AElig;schylus may best bear a comparison
with the angels and devils of Milton.
The style of the Athenian had, as we
have remarked, something of the Oriental
character; and the same peculiarity
may be traced in his mythology.
It has nothing of the amenity and
elegance which we generally find in
the superstitions of Greece. All is
rugged, barbaric, and colossal. The
legends of &AElig;schylus seem to harmonise
less with the fragrant groves and
graceful porticoes in which his countrymen
paid their vows to the God of
Light and Goddess of Desire, than
with those huge and grotesque labyrinths
of eternal granite in which Egypt
enshrined her mystic Osiris, or in
which Hindostan still bows down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
her seven-headed idols. His favourite
gods are those of the elder generation,
the sons of heaven and earth, compared
with whom Jupiter himself was a stripling
and an upstart, the gigantic Titans,
and the inexorable Furies. Foremost
among his creations of this class stands
Prometheus, half fiend, half redeemer,
the friend of man, the sullen and implacable
enemy of heaven. Prometheus
bears undoubtedly a considerable
resemblance to the Satan of Milton.
In both we find the same impatience
of control, the same ferocity, the same
unconquerable pride. In both characters
also are mingled, though in very
different proportions, some kind and
generous feelings. Prometheus, however,
is hardly superhuman enough. He
talks too much of his chains and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
uneasy posture: he is rather too much
depressed and agitated. His resolution
seems to depend on the knowledge
which he possesses that he holds the
fate of his torturer in his hands, and
that the hour of his release will surely
come. But Satan is a creature of another
sphere. The might of his intellectual
nature is victorious over the
extremity of pain. Amidst agonies
which cannot be conceived without
horror, he deliberates, resolves, and
even exults. Against the sword of Michael,
against the thunder of Jehovah,
against the flaming lake, and the marl
burning with solid fire, against the
prospect of an eternity of unintermitted
misery, his spirit bears up unbroken,
resting on its own innate
energies, requiring no support from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
anything external, nor even from hope
itself.</p>

<p>To return for a moment to the parallel
which we have been attempting to
draw between Milton and Dante, we
would add that the poetry of these
great men has in a considerable degree
taken its character from their moral
qualities. They are not egotists. They
rarely obtrude their idiosyncrasies on
their readers. They have nothing in
common with those modern beggars for
fame, who extort a pittance from the
compassion of the inexperienced by
exposing the nakedness and sores of
their minds. Yet it would be difficult
to name two writers whose works
have been more completely, though
undesignedly, coloured by their personal
feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The character of Milton was peculiarly
distinguished by loftiness of spirit;
that of Dante by intensity of feeling.
In every line of the Divine Comedy we
discern the asperity which is produced
by pride struggling with misery. There
is perhaps no work in the world so
deeply and uniformly sorrowful. The
melancholy of Dante was no fantastic
caprice. It was not, as far as at this
distance of time can be judged, the
effect of external circumstances. It
was from within. Neither love nor
glory, neither the conflicts of earth nor
the hope of heaven could dispel it. It
turned every consolation and every
pleasure into its own nature. It resembled
that noxious Sardinian soil of
which the intense bitterness is said to
have been perceptible even in its honey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
His mind was, in the noble language
of the Hebrew poet, "a land of darkness,
as darkness itself, and where the
light was as darkness." The gloom
of his characters discolours all the passions
of men, and all the face of nature,
and tinges with its own livid hue the
flowers of Paradise and the glories of
the eternal throne. All the portraits
of him are singularly characteristic.
No person can look on the features,
noble even to ruggedness, the dark furrows
of the cheek, the haggard and
woful stare of the eye, the sullen
and contemptuous curve of the lip,
and doubt that they belong to a man
too proud and too sensitive to be happy.</p>

<p>Milton was, like Dante, a statesman
and a lover; and, like Dante, he had
been unfortunate in ambition and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
love. He had survived his health and
his sight, the comforts of his home,
and the prosperity of his party. Of
the great men by whom he had been
distinguished at his entrance into life,
some had been taken away from the
evil to come; some had carried into
foreign climates their unconquerable
hatred of oppression; some were pining
in dungeons; and some had poured
forth their blood on scaffolds. Venal
and licentious scribblers, with just sufficient
talent to clothe the thoughts of
a pandar in the style of a bellman,
were now the favourite writers of the
Sovereign and of the public. It was
a loathsome herd, which could be compared
to nothing so fitly as to the
rabble of Comus, grotesque monsters,
half bestial, half human, dropping with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
wine, bloated with gluttony, and reeling
in obscene dances. Amidst these
that fair Muse was placed, like the
chaste lady of the Masque, lofty, spotless,
and serene, to be chattered at, and
pointed at, and grinned at, by the
whole rout of Satyrs and Goblins. If
ever despondency and asperity could be
excused in any man, they might have
been excused in Milton. But the
strength of his mind overcame every
calamity. Neither blindness, nor gout,
nor age, nor penury, nor domestic
afflictions, nor political disappointments,
nor abuse, nor proscription,
nor neglect, had power to disturb his
sedate and majestic patience. His
spirits do not seem to have been high,
but they were singularly equable. His
temper was serious, perhaps stern; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
it was a temper which no sufferings
could render sullen or fretful. Such as
it was when, on the eve of great
events, he returned from his travels, in
the prime of health and manly beauty,
loaded with literary distinctions, and
glowing with patriotic hopes, such it
continued to be when, after having
experienced every calamity which is
incident to our nature, old, poor, sightless,
and disgraced, he retired to his
hovel to die.</p>

<p>Hence it was that, though he wrote
the Paradise Lost at a time of life
when images of beauty and tenderness
are in general beginning to fade, even
from those minds in which they have
not been effaced by anxiety and disappointment,
he adorned it with all
that is most lovely and delightful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the physical and in the moral world.
Neither Theocritus nor Ariosto had
a finer or a more healthful sense of the
pleasantness of external objects, or
loved better to luxuriate amidst sunbeams
and flowers, the songs of nightingales,
the juice of summer fruits, and
the coolness of shady fountains. His
conception of love unites all the voluptuousness
of the Oriental harem, and
all the gallantry of the chivalric tournament,
with all the pure and quiet
affection of an English fireside. His
poetry reminds us of the miracles of
Alpine scenery. Nooks and dells,
beautiful as fairy-land, are embosomed
in its most rugged and gigantic elevations.
The roses and myrtles bloom
unchilled on the verge of the avalanche.</p>

<p>Traces, indeed, of the peculiar char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>acter
of Milton may be found in all
his works; but it is most strongly displayed
in the Sonnets. Those remarkable
poems have been undervalued by
critics who have not understood their
nature. They have no epigrammatic
point. There is none of the ingenuity
of Filicaja in the thought, none of the
hard and brilliant enamel of Petrarch
in the style. They are simple but
majestic records of the feelings of the
poet; as little tricked out for the public
eye as his diary would have been. A
victory, an expected attack upon the
city, a momentary fit of depression or
exultation, a jest thrown out against
one of his books, a dream which for
a short time restored to him that beautiful
face over which the grave had closed
for ever, led him to musings, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
without effort, shaped themselves into
verse. The unity of sentiment and
severity of style which characterise
these little pieces remind us of the
Greek Anthology, or perhaps still more
of the Collects of the English Liturgy.
The noble poem on the Massacres of
Piedmont is strictly a Collect in verse.</p>

<p>The Sonnets are more or less striking
according as the occasions which
gave birth to them are more or less
interesting. But they are, almost without
exception, dignified by a sobriety
and greatness of mind to which we
know not where to look for a parallel.
It would, indeed, be scarcely safe to
draw any decided inferences as to the
character of a writer from passages
directly egotistical. But the qualities
which we have ascribed to Milton,
though perhaps most strongly marked
in those parts of his works which treat
of his personal feelings, are distinguishable
in every page, and impart to all
his writings, prose and poetry, English,
Latin, and Italian, a strong family likeness.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
</div>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>His public conduct was such as was
to be expected from a man of a spirit
so high and of an intellect so powerful.
He lived at one of the most memorable
eras in the history of mankind, at the
very crisis of the great conflict between
Oromasdes and Arimanes, liberty and
despotism, reason and prejudice. That
great battle was fought for no single
generation, for no single land. The
destinies of the human race were staked
on the same cast with the freedom of
the English people. Then were first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
proclaimed those mighty principles
which have since worked their way
into the depths of the American forests,
which have roused Greece from the
slavery and degradation of two thousand
years, and which, from one end of
Europe to the other, have kindled an
unquenchable fire in the hearts of the
oppressed, and loosed the knees of the
oppressors with an unwonted fear.</p>

<p>Of those principles, then struggling
for their infant existence, Milton was
the most devoted and eloquent literary
champion. We need not say how
much we admire his public conduct.
But we cannot disguise from ourselves
that a large portion of his countrymen
still think it unjustifiable. The civil
war, indeed, has been more discussed,
and is less understood, than any event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in English history. The friends of
liberty laboured under the disadvantage
of which the lion in the fable complained
so bitterly. Though they were
the conquerors, their enemies were the
painters. As a body the Roundheads
had done their utmost to decry and ruin
literature; and literature was even with
them, as, in the long run, it always is
with its enemies. The best book on
their side of the question is the charming
narrative of Mrs. Hutchinson.
May's History of the Parliament is
good; but it breaks off at the most
interesting crisis of the struggle. The
performance of Ludlow is foolish and
violent; and most of the later writers
who have espoused the same cause,
Oldmixon for instance, and Catherine
Macaulay, have, to say the least, been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
more distinguished by zeal than either
by candour or by skill. On the other
side are the most authoritative and the
most popular historical works in our
language, that of Clarendon, and that
of Hume. The former is not only ably
written and full of valuable information,
but has also an air of dignity and
sincerity which makes even the prejudices
and errors with which it abounds
respectable. Hume, from whose fascinating
narrative the great mass of the
reading public are still contented to
take their opinions, hated religion so
much that he hated liberty for having
been allied with religion, and has pleaded
the cause of tyranny with the dexterity
of an advocate while affecting the
impartiality of a judge.</p>

<p>The public conduct of Milton must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
be approved or condemned according
as the resistance of the people to
Charles the First shall appear to be
justifiable or criminal. We shall therefore
make no apology for dedicating a
few pages to the discussion of that
interesting and most important question.
We shall not argue it on general grounds.
We shall not recur to those primary
principles from which the claim of any
government to the obedience of its
subjects is to be deduced. We are
entitled to that vantage-ground; but we
will relinquish it. We are, on this
point, so confident of superiority, that
we are not unwilling to imitate the
ostentatious generosity of those ancient
knights, who vowed to joust without
helmet or shield against all enemies,
and to give their antagonists the advan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>tage
of sun and wind. We will take
the naked constitutional question. We
confidently affirm, that every reason
which can be urged in favour of the
Revolution of 1688 may be urged
with at least equal force in favour of
what is called the Great Rebellion.</p>

<p>In one respect only, we think, can
the warmest admirers of Charles venture
to say that he was a better sovereign
than his son. He was not, in name
and profession, a Papist; we say in
name and profession, because both
Charles himself and his creature Laud,
while they abjured the innocent badges
of Popery, retained all its worst vices,
a complete subjection of reason to
authority, a weak preference of form
to substance, a childish passion for
mummeries, an idolatrous veneration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
for the priestly character, and, above
all, a merciless intolerance. This,
however, we waive. We will concede
that Charles was a good Protestant;
but we say that his Protestantism does
not make the slightest distinction between
his case and that of James.</p>

<p>The principles of the Revolution have
often been grossly misrepresented, and
never more than in the course of the
present year. There is a certain class
of men who, while they profess to
hold in reverence the great names
and great actions of former times,
never look at them for any other purpose
than in order to find in them
some excuse for existing abuses. In
every venerable precedent they pass by
what is essential, and take only what
is accidental: they keep out of sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
what is beneficial, and hold up to public
imitation all that is defective. If, in
any part of any great example, there
be anything unsound, these flesh-flies
detect it with an unerring instinct, and
dart upon it with a ravenous delight.
If some good end has been attained
in spite of them, they feel, with their
prototype, that</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="indent6">"Their labour must be to pervert that end,<br />
And out of good still to find means of evil."</p>
</div>

<p>To the blessings which England has
derived from the Revolution these
people are utterly insensible. The
expulsion of a tyrant, the solemn recognition
of popular rights, liberty,
security, toleration, all go for nothing
with them. One sect there was, which,
from unfortunate temporary causes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
it was thought necessary to keep under
close restraint. One part of the empire
there was so unhappily circumstanced,
that at that time its misery was necessary
to our happiness, and its slavery
to our freedom. These are the parts
of the Revolution which the politicians
of whom we speak love to contemplate,
and which seem to them not indeed
to vindicate, but in some degree to
palliate, the good which it has produced.
Talk to them of Naples, of Spain,
or of South America. They stand
forth zealots for the doctrine of Divine
Right which has now come back to us,
like a thief from transportation, under
the <em>alias</em> of Legitimacy. But mention
the miseries of Ireland. Then William
is a hero. Then Somers and Shrewsbury
are great men. Then the Revo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>lution
is a glorious era. The very same
persons who, in this country, never
omit an opportunity of reviving every
wretched Jacobite slander respecting
the Whigs of that period, have no
sooner crossed St. George's Channel
than they begin to fill their bumpers
to the glorious and immortal memory.
They may truly boast that they look
not at men, but at measures. So that
evil be done, they care not who does it;
the arbitrary Charles, or the liberal
William, Ferdinand the Catholic, or
Frederic the Protestant. On such
occasions their deadliest opponents may
reckon upon their candid construction.
The bold assertions of these people
have of late impressed a large portion
of the public with an opinion that
James the Second was expelled simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
because he was a Catholic, and that
the Revolution was essentially a Protestant
Revolution.</p>

<p>But this certainly was not the case;
nor can any person who has acquired
more knowledge of the history of those
times than is to be found in Goldsmith's
Abridgment believe that, if
James had held his own religious opinions
without wishing to make proselytes,
or if, wishing even to make proselytes,
he had contented himself with exerting
only his constitutional influence for that
purpose, the Prince of Orange would
ever have been invited over. Our
ancestors, we suppose, knew their own
meaning; and, if we may believe them,
their hostility was primarily not to
popery, but to tyranny. They did not
drive out a tyrant because he was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Catholic; but they excluded Catholics
from the crown, because they thought
them likely to be tyrants. The ground
on which they, in their famous resolution,
declared the throne vacant, was
this, "that James had broken the
fundamental laws of the kingdom."
Every man, therefore, who approves
of the Revolution of 1688 must hold
that the breach of fundamental laws on
the part of the sovereign justifies resistance.
The question, then, is this:
Had Charles the First broken the
fundamental laws of England?</p>

<p>No person can answer in the negative,
unless he refuses credit, not merely
to all the accusations brought against
Charles by his opponents, but to the
narratives of the warmest Royalists,
and to the confessions of the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
himself. If there be any truth in any
historian of any party who has related
the events of that reign, the conduct of
Charles, from his accession to the meeting
of the Long Parliament, had been
a continued course of oppression and
treachery. Let those who applaud the
Revolution, and condemn the Rebellion
mention one act of James the Second
to which a parallel is not to be found
in the history of his father. Let them
lay their fingers on a single article in
the Declaration of Right, presented
by the two Houses to William and
Mary, which Charles is not acknowledged
to have violated. He had, according
to the testimony of his own
friends, usurped the functions of the
legislature, raised taxes without the
consent of Parliament, and quartered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
troops on the people in the most illegal
and vexatious manner. Not a single
session of Parliament had passed without
some unconstitutional attack on
the freedom of debate; the right of
petition was grossly violated; arbitrary
judgments, exorbitant fines, and unwarranted
imprisonments were grievances
of daily occurrence. If these
things do not justify resistance, the
Revolution was treason; if they do,
the Great Rebellion was laudable.</p>

<p>But, it is said, why not adopt milder
measures? Why, after the king had
consented to so many reforms, and
renounced so many oppressive prerogatives,
did the Parliament continue to
rise in their demands at the risk of
provoking a civil war? The ship-money
had been given up. The Star<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Chamber had been abolished. Provision
had been made for the frequent
convocation and secure deliberation
of Parliaments. Why not pursue an
end confessedly good by peaceable and
regular means? We recur again to
the analogy of the Revolution. Why
was James driven from the throne?
Why was he not retained upon conditions?
He too had offered to call
a free Parliament, and to submit to its
decision all the matters in dispute. Yet
we are in the habit of praising our
forefathers, who preferred a revolution,
a disputed succession, a dynasty
of strangers, twenty years of foreign
and intestine war, a standing army, and
a national debt, to the rule, however
restricted, of a tried and proved tyrant.
The Long Parliament acted on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
same principle, and is entitled to the
same praise. They could not trust
the king. He had no doubt passed
salutary laws; but what assurance was
there that he would not break them?
He had renounced oppressive prerogatives;
but where was the security that he
would not resume them? The nation
had to deal with a man whom no tie
could bind, a man who made and broke
promises with equal facility, a man
whose honour had been a hundred
times pawned, and never redeemed.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, the Long Parliament
stands on still stronger ground than
the Convention of 1688. No action
of James can be compared to the conduct
of Charles with respect to the
Petition of Right. The Lords and
Commons present him with a bill in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
which the constitutional limits of his
power are marked out. He hesitates;
he evades; at last he bargains to give
his assent for five subsidies. The bill
receives his solemn assent; the subsidies
are voted; but no sooner is the
tyrant relieved, than he returns at once
to all the arbitrary measures which he
had bound himself to abandon, and
violates all the clauses of the very Act
which he had been paid to pass.</p>

<p>For more than ten years the people
had seen the rights which were theirs
by a double claim, by immemorial
inheritance and by recent purchase, infringed
by the perfidious king who had
recognised them. At length, circumstances
compelled Charles to summon
another Parliament: another chance
was given to our fathers: were they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
to throw it away as they had thrown
away the former? Were they again
to be cozened by <cite>le Roi le veut</cite>? Were
they again to advance their money on
pledges which had been forfeited over
and over again? Were they to lay a
second Petition of Right at the foot of
the throne, to grant another lavish aid
in exchange for another unmeaning
ceremony, and then to take their departure,
till, after ten years more of
fraud and oppression, their prince
should again require a supply, and
again repay it with a perjury? They
were compelled to choose whether they
would trust a tyrant or conquer him.
We think that they chose wisely and
nobly.</p>

<p>The advocates of Charles, like the
advocates of other malefactors against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
whom overwhelming evidence is produced,
generally decline all controversy
about the facts, and content themselves
with calling testimony to character.
He had so many private virtues!
And had James the Second no private
virtues? Was Oliver Cromwell,
his bitterest enemies themselves being
judges, destitute of private virtues?
And what, after all, are the virtues
ascribed to Charles? A religious zeal,
not more sincere than that of his son,
and fully as weak and narrow-minded,
and a few of the ordinary household
decencies which half the tombstones in
England claim for those who lie beneath
them. A good father! A good
husband! Ample apologies indeed for
fifteen years of persecution, tyranny,
and falsehood!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>We charge him with having broken
his coronation oath; and we are told
that he kept his marriage vow! We
accuse him of having given up his
people to the merciless inflictions of
the most hot-headed and hard-hearted
of prelates; and the defence is, that
he took his little son on his knee
and kissed him! We censure him
for having violated the articles of the
Petition of Right, after having, for good
and valuable consideration, promised to
observe them; and we are informed
that he was accustomed to hear prayers
at six o'clock in the morning! It is to
such considerations as these, together
with his Vandyke dress, his handsome
face, and his peaked beard, that he
owes, we verily believe, most of his
popularity with the present generation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>For ourselves, we own that we do
not understand the common phrase,
a good man, but a bad king. We can
as easily conceive a good man and an
unnatural father, or a good man and
a treacherous friend. We cannot, in
estimating the character of an individual,
leave out of our consideration his
conduct in the most important of all
human relations; and if in that relation
we find him to have been selfish, cruel,
and deceitful, we shall take the liberty
to call him a bad man, in spite of all
his temperance at table, and all his
regularity at chapel.</p>

<p>We cannot refrain from adding a
few words respecting a topic on which
the defenders of Charles are fond of
dwelling. If, they say, he governed
his people ill, he at least governed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
after the example of his predecessors.
If he violated their privileges, it was
because those privileges had not been
accurately defined. No act of oppression
has ever been imputed to him
which has not a parallel in the annals
of the Tudors. This point Hume has
laboured, with an art which is as discreditable
in a historical work as it
would be admirable in a forensic address.
The answer is short, clear, and decisive.
Charles had assented to the Petition of
Right. He had renounced the oppressive
powers said to have been exercised
by his predecessors, and he had renounced
them for money. He was
not entitled to set up his antiquated
claims against his own recent release.</p>

<p>These arguments are so obvious,
that it may seem superfluous to dwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
upon them. But those who have observed
how much the events of that
time are misrepresented and misunderstood
will not blame us for stating the
case simply. It is a case of which
the simplest statement is the strongest.</p>

<p>The enemies of the Parliament, indeed,
rarely choose to take issue on the
great points of the question. They
content themselves with exposing some
of the crimes and follies to which public
commotions necessarily give birth.
They bewail the unmerited fate of
Strafford. They execrate the lawless
violence of the army. They laugh at
the Scriptural names of the preachers.
Major-generals fleecing their districts;
soldiers revelling on the spoils of a
ruined peasantry; upstarts, enriched by
the public plunder, taking possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the hospitable firesides and hereditary
trees of the old gentry; boys smashing
the beautiful windows of cathedrals;
Quakers riding naked through the
market-place; Fifth-monarchy men
shouting for King Jesus; agitators
lecturing from the tops of tubs on
the fate of Agag; all these, they tell
us, were the offspring of the Great
Rebellion.</p>

<p>Be it so. We are not careful to
answer in this matter. These charges,
were they infinitely more important,
would not alter our opinion of an event
which alone has made us to differ from
the slaves who crouch beneath despotic
sceptres. Many evils, no doubt, were
produced by the civil war. They were
the price of our liberty. Has the acquisition
been worth the sacrifice? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
is the nature of the Devil of tyranny
to tear and rend the body which he
leaves. Are the miseries of continued
possession less horrible than
the struggles of the tremendous exorcism?</p>

<p>If it were possible that a people
brought up under an intolerant and arbitrary
system could subvert that system
without acts of cruelty and folly,
half the objections to despotic power
would be removed. We should, in that
case, be compelled to acknowledge that
it at least produces no pernicious effects
on the intellectual and moral character
of a nation. We deplore the outrages
which accompany revolutions. But the
more violent the outrages, the more assured
we feel that a revolution was
necessary. The violence of those out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>rages
will always be proportioned to the
ferocity and ignorance of the people;
and the ferocity and ignorance of the
people will be proportioned to the oppression
and degradation under which
they have been accustomed to live.
Thus it was in our civil war. The
heads of the church and state reaped
only that which they had sown. The
government had prohibited free discussion:
it had done its best to keep the
people unacquainted with their duties
and their rights. The retribution was
just and natural. If our rulers suffered
from popular ignorance, it was because
they had themselves taken away the key
of knowledge. If they were assailed
with blind fury, it was because they had
exacted an equally blind submission.</p>

<p>It is the character of such revolu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>tions
that we always see the worst of
them at first. Till men have been some
time free, they know not how to use
their freedom. The natives of wine
countries are generally sober. In climates
where wine is a rarity intemperance
abounds. A newly liberated people
may be compared to a northern army
encamped on the Rhine or the Xeres.
It is said that, when soldiers in such a
situation first find themselves able to
indulge without restraint in such a rare
and expensive luxury, nothing is to be
seen but intoxication. Soon, however,
plenty teaches discretion; and, after
wine has been for a few months their
daily fare, they become more temperate
than they had ever been in their own
country. In the same manner, the
final and permanent fruits of liberty are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
wisdom, moderation, and mercy. Its
immediate effects are often atrocious
crimes, conflicting errors, skepticism on
points the most clear, dogmatism on
points the most mysterious. It is just
at this crisis that its enemies love to
exhibit it. They pull down the scaffolding
from the half-finished edifice:
they point to the flying dust, the falling
bricks, the comfortless rooms, the
frightful irregularity of the whole appearance;
and then ask in scorn where
the promised splendour and comfort is
to be found. If such miserable sophisms
were to prevail there would never
be a good house or a good government
in the world.</p>

<p>Ariosto tells a pretty story of a fairy,
who, by some mysterious law of her
nature, was condemned to appear at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
certain seasons in the form of a foul
and poisonous snake. Those who injured
her during the period of her disguise
were for ever excluded from
participation in the blessings which she
bestowed. But to those who, in spite
of her loathsome aspect, pitied and protected
her, she afterward revealed herself
in the beautiful and celestial form
which was natural to her, accompanied
their steps, granted all their wishes,
filled their houses with wealth, made
them happy in love and victorious in
war. Such a spirit is Liberty. At times
she takes the form of a hateful reptile.
She grovels, she hisses, she stings. But
woe to those who in disgust shall venture
to crush her! And happy are
those who, having dared to receive her
in her degraded and frightful shape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
shall at length be rewarded by her in
the time of her beauty and her glory!</p>

<p>There is only one cure for the evils
which newly acquired freedom produces;
and that cure is freedom. When
a prisoner first leaves his cell he cannot
bear the light of day: he is unable
to discriminate colours, or recognise
faces. But the remedy is not to remand
him into his dungeon, but to
accustom him to the rays of the sun.
The blaze of truth and liberty may at
first dazzle and bewilder nations which
have become half blind in the house of
bondage. But let them gaze on, and
they will soon be able to bear it. In a
few years men learn to reason. The
extreme violence of opinions subsides.
Hostile theories correct each other.
The scattered elements of truth cease
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
to contend, and begin to coalesce. And
at length a system of justice and order
is educed out of the chaos.</p>

<p>Many politicians of our time are in
the habit of laying it down as a self-evident
proposition, that no people
ought to be free till they are fit to use
their freedom. The maxim is worthy
of the fool in the old story who resolved
not to go into the water till he had
learnt to swim. If men are to wait
for liberty till they become wise and
good in slavery, they may indeed wait
for ever.</p>

<p>Therefore it is that we decidedly approve
of the conduct of Milton and
the other wise and good men who, in
spite of much that was ridiculous and
hateful in the conduct of their associates,
stood firmly by the cause of Public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Liberty. We are not aware that the
poet has been charged with personal
participation in any of the blamable
excesses of that time. The favourite
topic of his enemies is the line of conduct
which he pursued with regard to
the execution of the king. Of that
celebrated proceeding we by no means
approve. Still we must say, in justice
to the many eminent persons who concurred
in it, and in justice more particularly
to the eminent person who
defended it, that nothing can be more
absurd than the imputations which, for
the last hundred and sixty years, it has
been the fashion to cast upon the Regicides.
We have, throughout, abstained
from appealing to first principles. We
will not appeal to them now. We recur
again to the parallel case of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Revolution. What essential distinction
can be drawn between the execution
of the father and the deposition of the
son? What constitutional maxim is
there which applies to the former and
not to the latter? The king can do
no wrong. If so, James was as innocent
as Charles could have been. The
minister only ought to be responsible
for the acts of the sovereign. If
so, why not impeach Jefferies and retain
James? The person of a king is
sacred. Was the person of James considered
sacred at the Boyne? To discharge
cannon against an army in which
a king is known to be posted is to approach
pretty near to regicide. Charles,
too, it should always be remembered,
was put to death by men who had been
exasperated by the hostilities of several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
years, and who had never been bound
to him by any other tie than that which
was common to them with all their fellow
citizens. Those who drove James
from his throne, who seduced his army,
who alienated his friends, who first imprisoned
him in his palace, and then
turned him out of it, who broke in upon
his very slumbers by imperious messages,
who pursued him with fire and
sword from one part of the empire to
another, who hanged, drew, and quartered
his adherents, and attainted his
innocent heir, were his nephew and his
two daughters. When we reflect on
all these things, we are at a loss to conceive
how the same persons who, on
the fifth of November, thank God for
wonderfully conducting his servant
William, and for making all opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
fall before him until he became our
king and governor, can, on the thirtieth
of January, contrive to be afraid
that the blood of the Royal Martyr
may be visited on themselves and their
children.</p>

<p>We disapprove, we repeat, of the
execution of Charles; not because the
constitution exempts the king from
responsibility, for we know that all
such maxims, however excellent, have
their exceptions; nor because we feel
any peculiar interest in his character,
for we think that his sentence describes
him with perfect justice as "a tyrant,
a traitor, a murderer, and a public
enemy;" but because we are convinced
that the measure was most injurious to
the cause of freedom. He whom it
removed was a captive and a hostage:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
his heir, to whom the allegiance of
every Royalist was instantly transferred,
was at large. The Presbyterians
could never have been perfectly
reconciled to the father: they had no
such rooted enmity to the son. The
great body of the people, also, contemplated
that proceeding with feelings
which, however unreasonable, no government
could safely venture to outrage.</p>

<p>But though we think the conduct of
the Regicides blamable, that of Milton
appears to us in a very different light.
The deed was done. It could not be
undone. The evil was incurred; and
the object was to render it as small as
possible. We censure the chiefs of the
army for not yielding to the popular
opinion; but we cannot censure Milton
for wishing to change that opinion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
The very feeling which would have restrained
us from committing the act
would have led us, after it had been
committed, to defend it against the
ravings of servility and superstition.
For the sake of public liberty, we wish
that the thing had not been done, while
the people disapproved of it. But, for
the sake of public liberty, we should
also have wished the people to approve
of it when it was done. If anything
more were wanting to the justification
of Milton, the book of Salmasius would
furnish it. That miserable performance
is now with justice considered only as a
beacon to word-catchers, who wish to
become statesmen. The celebrity of
the man who refuted it, the "&AElig;ne&aelig;
magni dextra," gives it all its fame with
the present generation. In that age
the state of things was different. It
was not then fully understood how vast
an interval separates the more classical
scholar from the political philosopher.
Nor can it be doubted that a treatise
which, bearing the name of so eminent
a critic, attacked the fundamental principles
of all free governments, must, if
suffered to remain unanswered, have
produced a most pernicious effect on
the public mind.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
</div>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>We wish to add a few words relative
to another subject, on which the
enemies of Milton delight to dwell, his
conduct during the administration of
the Protector. That an enthusiastic
votary of liberty should accept office
under a military usurper seems, no
doubt, at first sight, extraordinary.
But all the circumstances in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the country was then placed were
extraordinary. The ambition of
Oliver was of no vulgar kind. He
never seems to have coveted despotic
power. He at first fought sincerely
and manfully for the Parliament, and
never deserted it, till it had deserted its
duty. If he dissolved it by force, it
was not till he found that the few
members who remained after so many
deaths, secessions, and expulsions, were
desirous to appropriate to themselves a
power which they held only in trust,
and to inflict upon England the curse
of a Venetian oligarchy. But even
when thus placed by violence at the
head of affairs, he did not assume unlimited
power. He gave the country
a constitution far more perfect than
any which had at that time been known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
in the world. He reformed the representative
system in a manner which
has extorted praise even from Lord
Clarendon. For himself he demanded
indeed the first place in the commonwealth;
but with powers scarcely so
great as those of a Dutch stadtholder,
or an American president. He gave
the Parliament a voice in the appointment
of ministers, and left to it the
whole legislative authority, not even
reserving to himself a veto on its enactments;
and he did not require that the
chief magistracy should be hereditary
in his family. Thus far, we think, if
the circumstances of the time and the
opportunities which he had of aggrandising
himself be fairly considered, he
will not lose by comparison with Washington
or Bolivar. Had his moderation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
been met with corresponding moderation,
there is no reason to think that he
would have overstepped the line which
he had traced for himself. But when
he found that his parliaments questioned
the authority under which they met,
and that he was in danger of being
deprived of the restricted power which
was absolutely necessary to his personal
safety, then, it must be acknowledged,
he adopted a more arbitrary policy.</p>

<p>Yet, though we believe that the intentions
of Cromwell were at first
honest, though we believe that he was
driven from the noble course which he
had marked out for himself by the
almost irresistible force of circumstances,
though we admire, in common
with all men of all parties, the
ability and energy of his splendid administration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
we are not pleading for
arbitrary and lawless power, even in
his hands. We know that a good
constitution is infinitely better than
the best despot. But we suspect, that
at the time of which we speak the
violence of religious and political enmities
rendered a stable and happy
settlement next to impossible. The
choice lay, not between Cromwell and
liberty, but between Cromwell and the
Stuarts. That Milton chose well, no
man can doubt who fairly compares the
events of the protectorate with those
of the thirty years which succeeded it,
the darkest and most disgraceful in the
English annals. Cromwell was evidently
laying, though in an irregular
manner, the foundations of an admirable
system. Never before had religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
liberty and the freedom of discussion
been enjoyed in a greater degree. Never
had the national honour been better upheld
abroad, or the seat of justice better
filled at home. And it was rarely that
any opposition which stopped short of
open rebellion provoked the resentment
of the liberal and magnanimous
usurper. The institutions which he had
established, as set down in the Instrument
of Government, and the Humble
Petition and Advice, were excellent.
His practice, it is true, too often departed
from the theory of these institutions.
But, had he lived a few years
longer, it is probable that his institutions
would have survived him, and that his
arbitrary practice would have died with
him. His power had not been consecrated
by ancient prejudices. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
upheld only by his great personal qualities.
Little, therefore, was to be
dreaded from a second protector, unless
he was also a second Oliver Cromwell.
The events which followed his
decease are the most complete vindication
of those who exerted themselves
to uphold his authority. His death
dissolved the whole frame of society.
The army rose against the Parliament,
the different corps of the army against
each other. Sect raved against sect.
Party plotted against party. The Presbyterians,
in their eagerness to be revenged
on the Independents, sacrificed
their own liberty, and deserted all their
old principles. Without casting one
glance on the past, or requiring one
stipulation for the future, they threw
down their freedom at the feet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the most frivolous and heartless of
tyrants.</p>

<p>Then came those days, never to be
recalled without a blush, the days of
servitude without loyalty and sensuality
without love, of dwarfish talents
and gigantic vices, the paradise of cold
hearts and narrow minds, the golden
age of the coward, the bigot, and the
slave. The king cringed to his rival
that he might trample on his people,
sank into a viceroy of France, and
pocketed, with complacent infamy, her
degrading insults, and her more degrading
gold. The caresses of harlots, and
the jests of buffoons, regulated the
policy of the state. The government
had just ability enough to deceive, and
just religion enough to persecute. The
principles of liberty were the scoff of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
every grinning courtier, and the Anathema
Maranatha of every fawning
dean. In every high place, worship
was paid to Charles and James, Belial
and Moloch; and England propitiated
those obscene and cruel idols with the
blood of her best and bravest children.
Crime succeeded to crime, and disgrace
to disgrace, till the race accursed of
God and man was a second time driven
forth, to wander on the face of the
earth, and to be a byword and a shaking
of the head to the nations.</p>

<p>Most of the remarks which we have
hitherto made on the public character
of Milton apply to him only as one of
a large body. We shall proceed to
notice some of the peculiarities which
distinguished him from his contemporaries.
And, for that purpose, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
necessary to take a short survey of the
parties into which the political world
was at that time divided. We must
premise, that our observations are intended
to apply only to those who
adhered, from a sincere preference,
to one or to the other side. In days
of public commotion, every faction,
like an Oriental army, is attended by
a crowd of camp-followers, an useless
and heartless rabble, who prowl around
its line of march in the hope of picking
up something under its protection, but
desert it in the day of battle, and often
join to exterminate it after a defeat.
England, at the time of which we are
treating, abounded with fickle and selfish
politicians, who transferred their
support to every government as it rose,
who kissed the hand of the king in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
1640, and spat in his face in 1649,
who shouted with equal glee when
Cromwell was inaugurated in Westminster
Hall, and when he was dug
up to be hanged at Tyburn, who dined
on calves' heads, or stuck up oak-branches,
as circumstances altered,
without the slightest shame or repugnance.
These we leave out of the
account. We take our estimate of
parties from those who really deserved
to be called partisans.</p>

<p>We would speak first of the Puritans,
the most remarkable body of men, perhaps,
which the world has ever produced.
The odious and ridiculous
parts of their character lie on the surface.
He that runs may read them;
nor have there been wanting attentive
and malicious observers to point them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
out. For many years after the Restoration,
they were the theme of unmeasured
invective and derision. They
were exposed to the utmost licentiousness
of the press and of the stage, at
the time when the press and the stage
were most licentious. They were not
men of letters; they were as a body,
unpopular; they could not defend themselves;
and the public would not take
them under its protection. They were
therefore abandoned, without reserve,
to the tender mercies of the satirists
and dramatists. The ostentatious simplicity
of their dress, their sour aspect,
their nasal twang, their stiff
posture, their long graces, their Hebrew
names, the Scriptural phrases
which they introduced on every occasion,
their contempt of human learning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
their detestation of polite amusements,
were indeed fair game for the laughers.
But it is not from the laughers alone
that the philosophy of history is to be
learnt. And he who approaches this
subject should carefully guard against
the influence of that potent ridicule
which has already misled so many
excellent writers.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>"Ecco il fonte del riso, ed ecco il rio<br />
Che mortali perigli in se contiene:<br />
Hor qui tener a fren nostro desio,<br />
Ed esser cauti molto a noi conviene."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Those who roused the people to
resistance, who directed their measures
through a long series of eventful years,
who formed, out of the most unpromising
materials, the finest army that
Europe had ever seen, who trampled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
down King, Church, and Aristocracy,
who, in the short intervals of domestic
sedition and rebellion, made the name
of England terrible to every nation on
the face of the earth, were no vulgar
fanatics. Most of their absurdities
were mere external badges, like the
signs of freemasonry, or the dresses
of friars. We regret that these badges
were not more attractive. We regret
that a body to whose courage and talents
mankind has owed inestimable obligations
had not the lofty elegance which
distinguished some of the adherents
of Charles the First, or the easy good-breeding
for which the court of Charles
the Second was celebrated. But, if we
must make our choice, we shall, like
Bassanio in the play, turn from the
specious caskets which contain only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the Death's head and the Fool's head,
and fix on the plain leaden chest
which conceals the treasure.</p>

<p>The Puritans were men whose minds
had derived a peculiar character from
the daily contemplation of superior
beings and eternal interests. Not content
with acknowledging, in general
terms, an overruling Providence, they
habitually ascribed every event to the
will of the Great Being, for whose
power nothing was too vast, for whose
inspection nothing was too minute.
To know him, to serve him, to enjoy
him, was with them the great end of
existence. They rejected with contempt
the ceremonious homage which
other sects substituted for the pure
worship of the soul. Instead of catching
occasional glimpses of the Deity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
through an obscuring veil, they aspired
to gaze full on his intolerable brightness,
and to commune with him face
to face. Hence originated their contempt
for terrestrial distinctions. The
difference between the greatest and the
meanest of mankind seemed to vanish,
when compared with the boundless
interval which separated the whole
race from him on whom their own eyes
were constantly fixed. They recognised
no title to superiority but his
favour; and, confident of that favour,
they despised all the accomplishments
and all the dignities of the world. If
they were unacquainted with the works
of philosophers and poets, they were
deeply read in the oracles of God. If
their names were not found in the
registers of heralds, they were recorded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
in the Book of Life. If their steps
were not accompanied by a splendid
train of menials, legions of ministering
angels had charge over them. Their
palaces were houses not made with
hands; their diadems crowns of glory
which should never fade away. On
the rich and the eloquent, on nobles
and priests they looked down with
contempt: for they esteemed themselves
rich in a more precious treasure, and
eloquent in a more sublime language,
nobles by the right of an earlier creation,
and priests by the imposition of
a mightier hand. The very meanest
of them was a being to whose fate
a mysterious and terrible importance
belonged, on whose slightest action the
spirits of light and darkness looked
with anxious interest, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
destined, before heaven and earth were
created, to enjoy a felicity which should
continue when heaven and earth should
have passed away. Events which
short-sighted politicians ascribed to
earthly causes, had been ordained on
his account. For his sake empires
had risen, and flourished, and decayed.
For his sake the Almighty had proclaimed
his will by the pen of the
Evangelist, and the harp of the prophet.
He had been wrested by no common
deliverer from the grasp of no common
foe. He had been ransomed by the
sweat of no vulgar agony, by the blood
of no earthly sacrifice. It was for him
that the sun had been darkened, that
the rocks had been rent, that the dead
had risen, that all nature had shuddered
at the sufferings of her expiring God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the Puritan was made up of
two different men, the one all self-abasement,
penitence, gratitude, passion,
the other proud, calm, inflexible, sagacious.
He prostrated himself in the
dust before his Maker; but he set his
foot on the neck of his king. In his
devotional retirement, he prayed with
convulsions, and groans, and tears.
He was half-maddened by glorious or
terrible illusions. He heard the lyres
of angels or the tempting whispers of
fiends. He caught a gleam of the
Beatific Vision, or woke screaming
from dreams of everlasting fire. Like
Vane, he thought himself intrusted
with the sceptre of the millennial year.
Like Fleetwood, he cried in the bitterness
of his soul that God had hid his
face from him. But when he took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
his seat in the council, or girt on his
sword for war, these tempestuous workings
of the soul had left no perceptible
trace behind them. People who saw
nothing of the godly but their uncouth
visages, and heard nothing from them
but their groans and their whining
hymns, might laugh at them. But
those had little reason to laugh who
encountered them in the hall of debate
or in the field of battle. These fanatics
brought to civil and military affairs a
coolness of judgment and an immutability
of purpose which some writers
have thought inconsistent with their
religious zeal, but which were in fact
the necessary effects of it. The intensity
of their feelings on one subject
made them tranquil on every other.
One overpowering sentiment had subjected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
to itself pity and hatred, ambition
and fear. Death had lost its terrors
and pleasure its charms. They had
their smiles and their tears, their raptures
and their sorrows, but not for
the things of this world. Enthusiasm
had made them Stoics, had cleared their
minds from every vulgar passion and
prejudice, and raised them above the
influence of danger and of corruption.
It sometimes might lead them to pursue
unwise ends, but never to choose
unwise means. They went through
the world, like Sir Artegal's iron man
Talus with his flail, crushing and trampling
down oppressors, mingling with
human beings, but having neither part
or lot in human infirmities, insensible
to fatigue, to pleasure, and to
pain, not to be pierced by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
weapon, not to be withstood by any
barrier.</p>

<p>Such we believe to have been the
character of the Puritans. We perceive
the absurdity of their manners. We
dislike the sullen gloom of their domestic
habits. We acknowledge that
the tone of their minds was often
injured by straining after things too
high for mortal reach: and we know
that, in spite of their hatred of Popery,
they too often fell into the worst vices
of that bad system, intolerance and
extravagant austerity, that they had
their anchorites and their crusades,
their Dunstans and their De Monforts,
their Dominics and their Escobars.
Yet, when all circumstances
are taken into consideration, we do
not hesitate to pronounce them a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
brave, a wise, an honest, and an useful
body.</p>

<p>The Puritans espoused the cause of
civil liberty mainly because it was the
cause of religion. There was another
party, by no means numerous, but
distinguished by learning and ability,
which acted with them on very different
principles. We speak of those whom
Cromwell was accustomed to call the
Heathens, men who were, in the
phraseology of that time, doubting
Thomases or careless Gallios with
regard to religious subjects, but passionate
worshippers of freedom. Heated
by the study of ancient literature, they
set up their country as their idol, and
proposed to themselves the heroes of
Plutarch as their examples. They
seem to have borne some resemblance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to the Brissotines of the French Revolution.
But it is not very easy to draw
the line of distinction between them
and their devout associates, whose
tone and manner they sometimes
found it convenient to affect, and
sometimes, it is probable, imperceptibly
adopted.</p>

<p>We now come to the Royalists.
We shall attempt to speak of them,
as we have spoken of their antagonists,
with perfect candour. We shall not
charge upon a whole party the profligacy
and baseness of the horse-boys,
gamblers, and bravoes, whom the hope
of license and plunder attracted from
all the dens of Whitefriars to the
standard of Charles, and who disgraced
their associates by excesses which,
under the stricter discipline of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Parliamentary armies, were never tolerated.
We will select a more favourable
specimen. Thinking as we do
that the cause of the king was the
cause of bigotry and tyranny, we yet
cannot refrain from looking with complacency
on the character of the honest
old cavaliers. We feel a national
pride in comparing them with the
instruments which the despots of other
countries are compelled to employ,
with the mutes who throng their ante-chambers,
and the Janissaries who
mount guard at their gates. Our royalist
countrymen were not heartless,
dangling courtiers, bowing at every
step, and simpering at every word.
They were not mere machines for
destruction, dressed up in uniforms,
caned into skill, intoxicated into valour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
defending without love, destroying without
hatred. There was a freedom in
their very degradation. The sentiment of
individual independence was strong
within them. They were indeed misled,
but by no base or selfish motive.
Compassion and romantic honour, the
prejudices of childhood, and the venerable
names of history, threw over them
a spell potent as that of Duessa; and,
like the Red-Cross Knight, they
thought that they were doing battle for
an injured beauty, while they defended
a false and loathsome sorceress. In
truth they scarcely entered at all into
the merits of the political question. It
was not for a treacherous king or an
intolerant church that they fought, but
for the old banner which had waved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
in so many battles over the heads of
their fathers, and for the altars at which
they had received the hands of their
brides. Though nothing could be
more erroneous than their political
opinions, they possessed, in far greater
degree than their adversaries, those
qualities which are the grace of private
life. With many of the vices of the
Round Table, they had also many of
its virtues, courtesy, generosity, veracity,
tenderness, and respect for women.
They had far more both of profound
and of polite learning than the Puritans.
Their manners were more engaging,
their tempers more amiable, their tastes
more elegant, and their households
more cheerful.</p>

<p>Milton did not strictly belong to
any of the classes which we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
described. He was not a Puritan.
He was not a freethinker. He was
not a Royalist. In his character the
noblest qualities of every party were
combined in harmonious union. From
the Parliament and from the Court,
from the conventicle and from the
Gothic cloister, from the gloomy and
sepulchral circles of the Roundheads,
and from the Christmas revel of the
hospitable Cavalier, his nature selected
and drew to itself whatever was great
and good, while it rejected all the base
and pernicious ingredients by which
those finer elements were defiled.
Like the Puritans, he lived</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; ">"As ever in his great taskmaster's eye."</p>

<p>Like them, he kept his mind continually
fixed on an Almighty Judge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
and an eternal reward. And hence he
acquired their contempt of external
circumstances, their fortitude, their
tranquillity, their inflexible resolution.
But not the coolest sceptic or the
most profane scoffer was more perfectly
free from the contagion of their
frantic delusions, their savage manners,
their ludicrous jargon, their scorn of
science, and their aversion to pleasure.
Hating tyranny with a perfect hatred,
he had nevertheless all the estimable
and ornamental qualities which were
almost entirely monopolised by the
party of the tyrant. There was none
who had a stronger sense of the value
of literature, a finer relish for every
elegant amusement, or a more chivalrous
delicacy of honour and love.
Though his opinions were democratic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
his tastes and his associations were such
as harmonise best with monarchy and
aristocracy. He was under the influence
of all the feelings by which the
gallant Cavaliers were misled. But of
those feelings he was the master and
not the slave. Like the hero of
Homer, he enjoyed all the pleasures
of fascination; but he was not fascinated.
He listened to the song of the
Syrens; yet he glided by without being
seduced to their fatal shore. He
tasted the cup of Circe; but he bore
about him a sure antidote against the
effects of its bewitching sweetness.
The allusions which captivated his
imagination never impaired his reasoning
powers. The statesman was
proof against the splendour, the solemnity,
and the romance which en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>chanted
the poet. Any person who
will contrast the sentiments expressed
in his treatises on Prelacy with the exquisite
lines on ecclesiastical architecture
and music in the Penseroso, which
was published about the same time,
will understand our meaning. This is
an inconsistency which, more than
anything else, raises his character in
our estimation, because it shows how
many private tastes and feelings he
sacrificed, in order to do what he considered
his duty to mankind. It is
the very struggle of the noble
Othello. His heart relents; but his
hand is firm. He does nought in
hate, but all in honour. He kisses
the beautiful deceiver before he destroys
her.</p>

<p>That from which the public char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>acter
of Milton derives its great and
peculiar splendour still remains to be
mentioned. If he exerted himself to
overthrow a forsworn king and a persecuting
hierarchy, he exerted himself
in conjunction with others. But the
glory of the battle which he fought
for the species of freedom which is the
most valuable, and which was then
the least understood, the freedom of
the human mind, is all his own.
Thousands and tens of thousands
among his contemporaries raised their
voices against Ship-money and the
Star-chamber. But there were few
indeed who discerned the more fearful
evils of moral and intellectual slavery,
and the benefits which would result
from the liberty of the press and the
unfettered exercise of private judg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>ment.
These were the objects which
Milton justly conceived to be the most
important. He was desirous that the
people should think for themselves as
well as tax themselves, and should
be emancipated from the dominion
of prejudice as well as from that of
Charles. He knew that those who,
with the best intentions, overlooked
these schemes of reform, and contented
themselves with pulling down
the king and imprisoning the malignants,
acted like the heedless brothers
in his own poem, who, in their
eagerness to disperse the train of
the sorcerer, neglected the means
of liberating the captive. They
thought only of conquering when
they should have thought of disenchanting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>"Oh, he mistook! Ye should have snatched his wand<br />
And bound him fast. Without the rod reversed,<br />
And backward mutters of dissevering power,<br />
We cannot free the lady that sits here<br />
Bound in strong fetters fixed and motionless."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>To reverse the rod, to spell the
charm backward, to break the ties
which bound a stupefied people to the
seat of enchantment, was the noble
aim of Milton. To this all his public
conduct was directed. For this he
joined the Presbyterians; for this he
forsook them. He fought their perilous
battle; but he turned away with
disdain from their insolent triumph.
He saw that they, like those whom
they had vanquished, were hostile to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the liberty of thought. He therefore
joined the Independents, and called
upon Cromwell to break the secular
chain, and to save free conscience
from the paw of the Presbyterian wolf.
With a view to the same great object,
he attacked the licensing system in
that sublime treatise which every
statesman should wear as a sign upon
his hand and as frontlets between his
eyes. His attacks were, in general,
directed less against particular abuses
than against those deeply seated errors
on which almost all abuses are founded,
the servile worship of eminent men
and the irrational dread of innovation.</p>

<p>That he might shake the foundations
of these debasing sentiments more
effectually, he always selected for himself
the boldest literary services. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
never came up in the rear when the
outworks had been carried and the
breach entered. He pressed into the
forlorn hope. At the beginning of
the changes, he wrote within comparable
energy and eloquence against the
bishops. But, when his opinion
seemed likely to prevail, he passed on
to other subjects, and abandoned prelacy
to the crowd of writers who now
hastened to insult a falling party.
There is no more hazardous enterprise
than that of bearing the torch of truth
into those dark and infected recesses
in which no light has ever shone.
But it was the choice and the pleasure
of Milton to penetrate the noisome
vapours, and to brave the terrible explosion.
Those who most disapprove of
his opinions must respect the hardihood
with which he maintained them.
He, in general, left to others the credit
of expounding and defending the popular
parts of his religious and political
creed. He took his own stand upon
those which the great body of his
countrymen reprobated as criminal, or
derided as paradoxical. He stood up
for divorce and regicide. He attacked
the prevailing systems of education.
His radiant and beneficent career resembled
that of the god of light and
fertility.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>It is to be regretted that the prose
writings of Milton should, in our time,
be so little read. As compositions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
they deserve the attention of every
man who wishes to become acquainted
with the full power of the English
language. They abound with passages
compared with which the finest
declamations of Burke sink into insignificance.
They are a perfect field of
cloth of gold. The style is stiff with
gorgeous embroidery. Not even in the
earlier books of the Paradise Lost
has the great poet ever risen higher
than in those parts of his controversial
works in which his feelings, excited by
conflict, find a vent in bursts of devotional
and lyric rapture. It is, to borrow
his own majestic language, "a
seven-fold chorus of hallelujahs and
harping symphonies."</p>

<p>We had intended to look more
closely at these performances, to analyse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the peculiarities of the diction, to
dwell at some length on the sublime
wisdom of the Areopagitica and the
nervous rhetoric of the Iconoclast, and
to point out some of those magnificent
passages which occur in the Treatise
of Reformation and the Animadversions
on the Remonstrant. But the
length to which our remarks have already
extended renders this impossible.</p>

<p>We must conclude. And yet we
can scarcely tear ourselves away from
the subject. The days immediately
following the publication of this relic
of Milton appear to be peculiarly set
apart, and consecrated to his memory.
And we shall scarcely be censured if,
on this his festival, we be found lingering
near his shrine, how worthless
soever may be the offering which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
bring to it. While this book lies on
our table, we seem to be contemporaries
of the writer. We are transported
a hundred and fifty years back.
We can almost fancy that we are visiting
him in his small lodging; that we
see him sitting at the old organ beneath
the faded green hangings; that
we can catch the quick twinkle of his
eyes, rolling in vain to find the day;
that we are reading in the lines of his
noble countenance the proud and
mournful history of his glory and his
affliction. We image to ourselves the
breathless silence in which we should
listen to his slightest word, the passionate
veneration with which we should
kneel to kiss his hand and weep upon
it, the earnestness with which we should
endeavour to console him, if indeed such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
a spirit could need consolation, for the
neglect of an age unworthy of his talents
and his virtues, the eagerness with
which we should contest with his
daughters, or with his Quaker friend
Elwood, the privilege of reading Homer
to him, or of taking down the
immortal accents which flowed from
his lips.</p>

<p>These are perhaps foolish feelings.
Yet we cannot be ashamed of them;
nor shall we be sorry if what we have
written shall in any degree excite them
in other minds. We are not much in
the habit of idolising either the living
or the dead. And we think that there
is no more certain indication of a weak
and ill-regulated intellect than that
propensity which, for want of a better
name, we will venture to christen Bos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>wellism.
But there are a few characters
which have stood the closest
scrutiny and the severest tests, which
have been tried in the furnace and have
proved pure, which have been weighed
in the balance and have not been found
wanting, which have been declared sterling
by the general consent of mankind,
and which are visibly stamped with the
image and superscription of the Most
High. These great men we trust that
we know how to prize; and of these
was Milton. The sight of his books,
the sound of his name, are pleasant to
us. His thoughts resemble those celestial
fruits and flowers which the
Virgin Martyr of Massinger sent down
from the gardens of Paradise to the
earth, and which were distinguished
from the productions of other soils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
not only by superior bloom and sweetness,
but by miraculous efficacy to
invigorate and to heal. They are
powerful, not only to delight, but to
elevate and purify. Nor do we envy
the man who can study either the life
or the writings of the great poet and
patriot, without aspiring to emulate,
not indeed the sublime works with
which his genius has enriched our literature,
but the zeal with which he
laboured for the public good, the fortitude
with which he endured every
private calamity, the lofty disdain with
which he looked down on temptations
and dangers, the deadly hatred which
he bore to bigots and tyrants, and the
faith which he so sternly kept with his
country and with his fame.</p>
